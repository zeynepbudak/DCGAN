GAN NETWORK & DCGAN 
Producing synthetic data takes its place at the top of the list of studies on artificial intelligence. 
In addition to producing data similar to a data, it can also produce visual, auditory and written works of art. 
We can also produce human faces that you cannot distinguish from the real thing. We can also imitate an artist's style. 
It can also be used to ensure that the data you will need in the medical field is reproduced by making use of the existing ones. 
All this is possible with the successful removal of patterns. Deep generative networks are not just GANs! 
I found different approaches such as Boltzmann machine approaches, Deep Belif Networks, Convolutional Boltzmann approaches, Directed Generative Nets and Variational Autoencoders were before and still used in GANs.

In this study, we will use the Fashion MNIST dataset and in this dataset, we will use a wide variety of shoes, boots, sandals, t-shirts, coats, bandanas, etc. 
Labeled samples of textile products are included.
